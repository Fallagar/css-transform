1) Design :
  -need to make window for result of calculations, think will do END and START date buttons to go up
      to make space
  -think about adding BEGIN button, do i really need it?
      -if needed, should END and START date be flying from edges after pressing BEGIN?
  -need to think about positions of elements, date picker absolute and others normal flow?
      -CHECK that moving elements don't affect layout
  -"created by" i think it's better to make subtle copyright in bottom-left/right corner
  
  2) Logic:
    -oh boy
    -learn how to make own libraries in JS to make code more reusable and clean
    -make basic version without checks for leap years
